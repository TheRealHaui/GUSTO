Using the Fltdyn GUI time classes
=================================

The fltdyn.gui.time packages provides components for graphically displaying and selecting times.
These may be used to build more complex components such as a schedule time-line with a time
axis.

TimeDemo0 is a simple program that displays a slider which allows a time to be selected.
Run the demo and try the following:

- Drag the cursor to change the time
- Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. You can zoom in to the level of seconds.
  Note that zooming occurs about the mouse position.
- Press and drag the mouse to scroll the pane. The pane cannot be scrolled if it is
  fully zoomed out.
- Double-click the mouse to jump to a time.
- Double right-click the mouse to zoom out fully.

TimeDemo1 adds a text field to display the selected time.

The TimeAxisPane class used in this demo makes use of several other classes:

The BoundedTimeModel is a model for the selected time and also specifies the allowed time range.
This range is a hard limit which may, for example, be imposed by the time range of the data.
It should not be confused with the time range displayed by the view.

The AxisPainter paints the axis with tick-marks and labels it. By default a CalendarAxisPainter
is used which displays UTC times and dates.

The BasicTimeProjection defines the mapping between times and positions on the axis. This
changes when the view is zoomed or scrolled, or the width of the view is changed. It is
possible to register a ChangeListener with the projection. This allows a set of time
views to be linked together using the MVC pattern, so that they all zoom and scroll
in step with the TimeAxisPane.

TimeDemo2 adds another pane which displays a schedule with two items. So as to not over-complicate
the example, the schedule data is created directly in the view without a separate schedule model.

Try zooming and scrolling the time axis and note that the axis and schedule changes in step.
