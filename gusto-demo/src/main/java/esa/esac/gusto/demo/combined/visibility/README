  
Example using time and sky classes to show Herschel visibility constraints
==========================================================================

The two views are linked by MVC. Moving the time slider changes both views.

The MGA constraint is the constraint on the telescope (+X) axis such that
the Sun is in the XZ plane and the MGA antenna (+Z) axis is pointing 
within a specified angle of the ground station.
